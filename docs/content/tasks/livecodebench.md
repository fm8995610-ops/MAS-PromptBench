# LiveCodeBench

LiveCodeBench collects programming problems from contest sites. Agents write a Python solution, and the runner counts it as solved only if it passes every hidden test.

The CLI and folder name for this task is `lcb`.

## The task

Each instance is a problem statement in one of two modes, chosen the same way as LiveCodeBench's own prompt templates:

- **Stdin mode** (no starter code): the program reads input from stdin and writes the answer to stdout.
- **Functional mode** (LeetCode-style starter code): the prompt includes the starter code, and the solution fills in the method.

Public test cases are not shown, matching LiveCodeBench. Agents can call `python_exec(code, stdin)`, which runs a snippet in a fresh Python subprocess with a 10-second timeout and returns stdout, stderr and the exit code.

The answering agent must end with one fenced `python` code block holding the submitted solution. The runner takes the last fenced block that parses as Python, preferring blocks labelled `python` or `py` over bare fences and skipping blocks that start with `{` or `[`.

## How it is scored

The runner runs the extracted code against every hidden test of the problem, with a 6-second timeout per test:

- **Stdin tests** run the program with the test input. The test passes if the program exits with code 0 and its output matches, either exactly or line by line with numeric tokens compared as decimals.
- **Functional tests** call `Solution().<fn_name>` (or a top-level `<fn_name>`) in a subprocess that applies LiveCodeBench's `reliability_guard` and a memory cap, then compare the return value with the expected one. The cap is `LCB_FUNCTIONAL_MEMORY_BYTES`, 4 GB by default; set it to `0` to disable it.

An instance scores 1 only if all tests pass (the pass@1 convention); otherwise 0. The batch prints pass@1 over all instances, over instances with extracted code, and per difficulty tier. Independent and Decentralized teams submit their agents' most common program (compared with whitespace normalized), and only that program is run against the tests.

!!! warning "Generated code runs on your machine"
    Both `python_exec` and the scorer run model-written code as plain subprocesses on the host, with timeouts but no container. Run batches on a machine you are comfortable exposing to untrusted code.

## Data

The runner loads the Hugging Face dataset `livecodebench/code_generation_lite`, split `test`. Hidden tests come from each row's `private_test_cases` field, which is stored compressed; the runner decodes it and skips rows without usable tests. Row IDs are LiveCodeBench `question_id` values, such as `1873_A`.

The 50 eval IDs are in [`benchmarks/lcb/lcb_eval_ids.json`](https://github.com/fm8995610-ops/MAS-PromptBench/blob/main/benchmarks/lcb/lcb_eval_ids.json); they are the first 50 rows, so `--limit 50` scores exactly that set.

## Run it

Run every command from the repository root. With no arguments, the single-agent runner runs two built-in problems, one in stdin mode and one in functional mode, and prints the extracted code and test results for each:

```bash title="Smoke demo"
python -m topologies.single.lcb.langgraph_lcb
```

A batch needs `--batch`:

=== "Single"

    ```bash
    python -m topologies.single.lcb.langgraph_lcb --batch --limit 50 \
      --out-dir results/topologies_baseline/single_lcb
    ```

=== "Sequential (LangGraph)"

    ```bash
    python -m topologies.sequential.langgraph.lcb.langgraph_lcb --batch --limit 50 \
      --out-dir results/topologies_baseline/sequential_langgraph_lcb
    ```

Each record has the predicted code, `pass` and `total` test counts, `pass_rate`, `em` (the pass@1 score), difficulty and platform. LiveCodeBench also has [communication-protocol](../mas/communication-protocols.md) and [team-size](../mas/team-sizes.md) runners.

## Optimize it

LiveCodeBench is one of the three tasks whose experiment grid has all eight optimizers on every multi-agent LangGraph team. Swap `--method` for any key. For example, TAVO on the Decentralized debate:

```bash title="TAVO on Decentralized · LiveCodeBench"
python -m optimizers.protocol.run --method tavo --dataset lcb --topology decentralized \
  --model qwen --seed 0 --out runs/tavo/lcb/decentralized/qwen/0
```

!!! note "A cheaper check during optimization"
    The run protocol scores LiveCodeBench on the first 3 private tests of each problem, not all of them. See [Evaluation Protocol](../evaluation/protocol.md).

## Flags

Beyond the common flags (`--batch`, `--limit`, `--offset`, `--only`, `--out-dir`, `--out`):

| Flag | Runners | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--difficulty {easy,medium,hard}` | all eight | Keep one difficulty tier. |
| `--platform {codeforces,leetcode,atcoder}` | LangGraph Sequential, Centralized and Decentralized | Keep one source platform. |
