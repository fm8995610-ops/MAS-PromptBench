# SWE-bench Verified

SWE-bench Verified pairs real GitHub issues with the tests that the maintainers' fix made pass. Agents edit a checkout of the repository, and the runner counts an instance as resolved only if the hidden tests pass with their change applied.

The CLI and folder name for this task is `swe`.

## The task

For each instance the runner clones `https://github.com/<repo>` into `<workdir-root>/<instance_id>` and checks out the instance's base commit. The agents get the issue text, the maintainers' hints when the dataset has them, and file tools scoped to that checkout:

| Topologies | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Single, Independent | `file_read`, `file_write`, `list_dir`, `search_repo`, `shell_exec` |
| Sequential, Centralized, Decentralized | `file_read`, `str_replace`, `list_dir`, `search_repo`, `shell_exec` |

Individual roles may get only some of these tools. The issue text is cut to 16,000 characters and the hints to 4,000 (`SWE_PROBLEM_CHAR_BUDGET`, `SWE_HINTS_CHAR_BUDGET`). The checkout has no test dependencies installed, and the prompt tells agents not to run the repository's tests. Independent replicas and Decentralized peers each work in their own clone.

`shell_exec` runs inside the instance's SWE-bench Singularity image, the same image used for evaluation: networking off, a clean environment, only the checkout mounted (its `.git` read-only), and bounded output, time, memory and open files. `SWE_SHELL_SANDBOX=0` runs commands on the host instead; use it only for debugging without Singularity.

The submitted patch is `git diff HEAD` of the checkout after the agents finish. The output contract also asks the answering role to end with a fenced `diff` block, but scoring uses the checkout's diff, not that text. Independent and Decentralized teams submit their agents' most common non-empty patch, and only that patch is evaluated.

## How it is scored

SWE-bench grading applies the dataset's `test_patch` (the hidden tests) and the model patch, then runs the instance's `FAIL_TO_PASS` and `PASS_TO_PASS` tests with pytest. An instance is **resolved** when every test in both lists passes; `XFAIL` counts as a pass. The reported metric is the fraction of instances resolved.

The `--eval` flag picks where the tests run:

| Mode | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `singularity` | Pulls `docker://swebench/sweb.eval.x86_64.<instance-tag>:latest` with `singularity pull`, caches it as `<instance_id>.sif` under `SWE_SIF_DIR` (default `~/containers/swe`), and runs both patches and pytest inside it. This matches the official Docker environment. |
| `local` | Applies the test patch in the checkout and runs pytest in your own environment. Fast, but not equivalent to the leaderboard. Single topology only. |
| `none` | Skips evaluation and only collects patches. |

Use `singularity` for reported numbers. Image pulls time out after 15 minutes and test runs after 30.

Every run writes to `--out-dir`: `predictions.jsonl` (`instance_id`, `model_patch`, `model_name_or_path`, the official harness format), `results.jsonl` (per-instance `f2p_rate`, `p2p_rate` and `resolved`), `patches/<instance_id>.diff`, `traces/<instance_id>.txt` and, with `singularity`, the test logs in `eval_logs/`. Both JSONL files are emptied when the batch starts, and each clone is deleted after its instance unless you pass `--keep-workdirs`. The end-of-batch report goes to stderr; the single-agent runner also logs a `swebench.harness.run_evaluation` command for the official Docker harness.

## Data

The runner loads `princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Verified` from Hugging Face. You also need `git` and network access to GitHub for the clones, and Singularity on your `PATH` for the agents' shell and for `singularity` mode. A full set of instance images takes tens of gigabytes; [the benchmarks README](https://github.com/fm8995610-ops/MAS-PromptBench/blob/main/benchmarks/README.md) lists the disk needs.

The 30 eval IDs in [`benchmarks/swe/swe_eval_ids.json`](https://github.com/fm8995610-ops/MAS-PromptBench/blob/main/benchmarks/swe/swe_eval_ids.json) are a balanced sample: 15 instances labelled "<15 min fix" and 15 labelled "15 min - 1 hour". They are not a slice of the split, so pass them with `--only` rather than `--limit 30`.

## Run it

Run every command from the repository root. There is no smoke demo; with no arguments a runner solves the first 2 instances, and `--batch` changes nothing.

Score the eval IDs by passing them to `--only`:

```bash title="Load the eval IDs"
MANIFEST=benchmarks/swe/swe_eval_ids.json
IDS=$(python -c "import json,sys; print(*json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))['ids'])" $MANIFEST)
```

Then run a topology:

=== "Single"

    ```bash
    python -m topologies.single.swe.langgraph_swe --only $IDS --eval singularity \
      --out-dir results/topologies_baseline/single_swe
    ```

=== "Sequential (LangGraph)"

    ```bash
    python -m topologies.sequential.langgraph.swe.langgraph_swe --only $IDS --eval singularity \
      --out-dir results/topologies_baseline/sequential_langgraph_swe
    ```

SWE-bench also has [communication-protocol](../mas/communication-protocols.md) runners under `communications/` and [team-size](../mas/team-sizes.md) runners under `teamsizes/`.

## Optimize it

Every optimizer runs through the same protocol command; change `--method` to switch. For example, GEPA on the single agent:

```bash title="GEPA on Single · SWE-bench Verified"
python -m optimizers.protocol.run --method gepa --dataset swe --topology single \
  --model qwen --seed 0 --out runs/gepa/swe/single/qwen/0
```

Combinations outside the experiment grid need `--allow-any-cell`; see [Optimize a task](index.md#optimize-a-task).

!!! warning "A structural score during optimization"
    The run protocol scores SWE-bench with a structural check only: a rollout scores 1 when the agents produce a unified diff with a header and at least one changed line. The patch is not applied and no tests run. See [Evaluation Protocol](../evaluation/protocol.md).

## Flags

Beyond the common flags (`--batch`, `--limit`, `--offset`, `--only`, `--out-dir`, `--out`):

| Flag | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--eval MODE` | `local` (Single), `singularity` (others) | Evaluation backend. Multi-agent runners accept only `singularity` and `none`. |
| `--skip-eval` | off | Alias for `--eval none` (LangGraph Centralized and Decentralized runners). |
| `--workdir-root DIR` | a `swe_work*` folder in your home directory, different per topology | Where repositories are cloned. |
| `--keep-workdirs` | off | Keep each clone after the instance finishes. |
| `--subset SPLIT` | `test` | Hugging Face split to load. |

`--limit` defaults to 2. Without `--out-dir`, output goes to a `results/swe_bench*` folder that differs per topology.
